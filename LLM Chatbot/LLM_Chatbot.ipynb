            "Welcome GitBook is a platform for capturing and documenting technical knowledge — from product docs, to internal knowledge bases and APIs. Overview Edit pages, collections, content and more. Import Find out how to easily migrate your existing documentation — and which formats GitBook supports. There are two methods for importing content into GitBook: Using our import tool Using Git Sync Using our import tool You can migrate and unify existing documentation in GitBook using the import tool. You have the option to import single or multiple pages — although some limits apply, which we’ll explain below. Permissions Only users with editor permissions or higher can edit pages. Supported import formats GitBook supports imports from websites or files in the following formats: Markdown (.md or .markdown) HTML (.html) Microsoft Word (.docx) We also support imports from: Confluence Notion GitHub Wiki Quip Dropbox Paper Google Docs If you want to import multiple pages , you can upload a ZIP file containing HTML or Markdown files. The Import panel When you create a new space space , you’ll have the option to import content from the bottom sheet of the first empty page: After choosing an input source, you can select the file you’d like to import. Although GitBook supports importing content from different sources, the result may differ from your source due to differences in product features and document formats. Limitations GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content: The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is 20 . The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is 20 . Importing via Git Sync If you want to import large amounts of content, you can use our Git Sync feature, which has no limitation on the amount of content that can be imported. To import using Git Sync, you’ll first need to add your content to a GitHub or GitLab repository — or folder if you're using a monorepo setup — as Markdown files. If your current tool does not support Markdown export, various online tools can assist with conversion from other formats, such as PDF, HTML, etc. Once you’ve set up your Git repository, simply set up a Git Sync integration in your GitBook organization. Be sure to select the direction GitHub -> GitBook when choosing the initial sync direction. If you’re having trouble with the import process using either method above, please get in touch with our support team — they’d be happy to help. Editor GitBook’s editor supports different writing formats, interactive blocks, helpful ways to organize your content and more. Navigation Learn about the UI and how to navigate pages in GitBook. Content structure Learn how to use pages, page groups, spaces and collections The structure of your content in GitBook is organized through pages, spaces and collections. Pages live inside of spaces, and collections are groups of spaces. Permissions Anyone with editor permissions and higher can create pages. People with creator permissions and higher can create new spaces and collections. Product Demo Learn more about: Spaces Organize the content you create and publish into spaces, which help you group related pages together Pages Add pages, groups, external links, and more to your GitBook spaces A page in GitBook is the place where you add, edit and embed content. Pages always live inside a space , allowing you to group up related content and create different sections for the topics or areas you’re covering. Table of contents You can create as many pages as you need in a space. They’re all visible on the left side of your screen in your space’s table of contents . Hide a page from the table of contents You can hide a page or group of pages from your site's table of contents by clicking the page’s Action menu and toggling and toggling Hide page . Hidden pages will still be indexable by search and GitBook AI, but will not appear in the table of contents in your published site. Hidden pages will still be accessible through direct links. If hidden the following will appear in the front matter of the markdown file when using Git Sync: Copy --- hidden : true --- Organizing your content There are three types of pages you can add: Pages A page has a title, and optional description, and an area where you can write and add any kind of content.‌ You can nest pages by dragging and dropping a page below an other in the table of contents. Doing this creates a subpage. Tip: There’s no limit to page nesting, but we’d recommend you avoid more than three levels of nesting to avoid an overly-complex navigation. When you change the title of a page, the page’s slug (the part at the very end of the URL, e.g. /hello-world /hello-world ) will also change — unless you’ve manually set the page’s slug previously. You can change the title and the slug of a page at any time by clicking opening the page’s Action menu and choosing Rename . Page groups Page groups make it easy to bring pages together into sections that cover related content. Page groups can only live at the top level of the table of contents . You cannot nest page groups inside page groups. To change the title and slug of a page group, click the Action menu icon icon next to the group title in the table of contents and choose Rename . External links External links are simply links to external sites and resources. Adding a link doesn’t create a page in your content. Clicking one in the sidebar will immediately open the link in a new tab. Create a new page You can create a new page or page group from table of contents. When in live edit mode or in a change request , you can create a new page by clicking Add new page > New document page at the bottom of your table of contents. Alternatively, you can hover between pages in the table of contents and click the + icon that appears. Once you’ve created a new page, you can add content to it using the editor . Create a page group Just like creating a new page, you can create a page group by choosing Add new page > New group from the bottom of your table of contents. Create an external link To add an external link to your space, click the Add new page button at the bottom of the table of contents, then choose New link New link . Give the link a title — this will appear in the table of contents — and then add the URL and click Insert . Add an icon or emoji to your page To add better visibility for readers when skimming your table of contents, you can add an optional icon or emoji to an individual page. The icon or emoji will appear in the table of contents, and next to the title at the top of the page. To add an icon or emoji, click the \" Add icon \" button when hovering the page title, or the emoji button to the left of the title. Customize the icon style Customize the icon style You can choose the style and weight of the icon in your published site's settings. You can find the icon's style settings and more here . Can’t see the option to create a new page? If live edits are disabled for your space, you’ll need to create or edit a change request . Once you’re in a change request, the New page button (which allows you to create pages, page groups and links) will be available in the table of contents. Alternatively, you may not have the correct permissions to edit a page. Collections Organize your spaces and group related ones together using collections Editing content With GitBook, you can edit your content in a number of ways, including using rich text, inline content, and Markdown. Live edits Collaborate on pages in real-time with your teammates Formatting your content You can format your content in a number of ways, using the context menu or keyboard shortcuts in the GitBook editor. Inline content Want to add more than just text to a page? You can use the inline palette to add images, links, math & TeX, and more. Markdown GitBook supports Markdown directly in the editor, so you can quickly and easily create content using common syntax. GitBook’s editor allows you to create formatted content using Markdown. Markdown is a popular markup syntax that’s widely known for its simplicity. GitBook supports it as a keyboard-friendly way to write rich and structured text. You can learn more about Markdown itself by visiting Common Mark . Text formatting GitBook supports all the classic inline Markdown formatting: Formatting Markdown version Result Bold **bold** text Italic _italic_ italic Strikethrough Strikethrough ~strikethrough~ strikethrough Titles Heading 1: # A first-level title Heading 2: ## A second-level title Heading 3: ### A third-level title Code blocks ```⏎ creates a new code block. ```py⏎ creates a new code block with Python syntax highlighting. We use Prism for syntax highlighting. You can use Test Drive Prism Test Drive Prism to check which languages Prism supports. If you notice a mismatch between GitBook and Prism, there’s a chance we’re a version or two behind. We’ll catch up soon! Lists GitBook automatically detects and creates ordered and unordered lists as you type. Begin a line with - or * to start an unordered bullet list. Begin a line with 1. to start a numbered list. Begin a line with - [ ] to start a task list. When writing any kind of list, hit Tab to add a indent, and to add a indent, and Shift+Tab to outdent. Quotes Begin a line with > to create a block quote. If you select an entire paragraph from start to end, typing > will wrap the content in a block quote. This is a block quote. Dividers Type --- then hit Enter to create a divider on your page. This is an example of a divider. Write with GitBook AI Use GitBook AI to generate and build content for your page You can use GitBook AI to create content on any empty line on your page. It can create all kinds of content — formatted in Markdown — including code samples, templates, page summaries and more. GitBook AI is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan.

For example: Write me a two-paragraph overview of why documentation is important for product teams. Alternatively, you can also choose from one of the suggested prompts or prompt starters: Continue writing If you click this option, GitBook AI will analyze the content on your current page and then generate more content based on that. Explain… Click this and then tell GitBook AI what you want it to explain. This isn’t limited by content on your page, so you can ask it to explain anything at all. Summarize Summarize As you can imagine, this option will summarize all the content on your page — great for writing a TL;DR at the bottom of a detailed document, or adding a quick summary at the top for people just checking in. Explain this This will break down the complex information on your page and explain it in simpler language — including explaining acronyms and other jargon. This is perfect if the page you’re reading involves a lot of complex information, or you want to add an explainer for less technical folks. Translate This mode will translate your current page into one of a set number of languages. If you want to translate into a language that’s not on the list, simply type it into the prompt box. FAQs How does GitBook AI use my data? We always follow our data protection practices to keep your data private. GitBook AI does not use your data to train AI models. We will only share the information you add to GitBook AI with OpenAI for the sole purpose of providing you with GitBook AI’s features. Take a look at OpenAI’s privacy policy for more information. How much does GitBook AI cost? GitBook AI is available as part of GitBook’s Pro and Enterprise plans. If you have a Free or Plus plan, you’ll need to upgrade to use GitBook AI writing and editing. Visit our pricing page to find out more about upgrading to Pro. Blocks How to add and edit blocks within your content — plus a full list of the standard blocks GitBook offers. Paragraphs Add a paragraph block to a page in GitBook so you can insert formatted text, inline images and more. A paragraph is the most basic content block you can use on GitBook. It’s exactly what it says — a paragraph of text. You can add other inline content to your paragraph, such as emojis, images and Math & TeX. You can also format your paragraph text using the context menu or keyboard shortcuts, or using Markdown . Example of a paragraph Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.” Representation in Markdown Because a paragraph block is just text, that’s how it’s represented in Markdown. Copy Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.” Headings Add heading blocks to a page to organize your content and improve SEO. Unordered lists Add an unordered list block to a page to quickly create bullet point lists — with indents if needed. Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order. They are effectively bullet point lists, with support for nesting as needed. When typing a list in GitBook, you can exit the list and start a new empty block below by hitting Enter twice. Example of unordered list Item Nested item Another nested item Yet another nested item Another item Yet another item To create nested items, you can use Tab to indent and ⇧ + Tab to outdent. Representation in Markdown Copy - Item - Nested item - Another nested item - Another nested item - Yet another nested item - Another item - Yet another item Ordered lists Add an ordered list to a page to create instructions or steps — perfect when you need to write a guide. Ordered lists, also called numbered lists, help you prioritize items or create a list of steps. Example of ordered list Item 1 Nested item 1.1 Nested item 1.1.1 Nested item 1.2 Item 2 Item 3 To create nested items, you can use Tab to indent and ⇧ + Tab to outdent. Representation in Markdown Copy 1. Item 1 1. Nested item 1.1 1. Nested item 1.1.1 2. Nested item 1.2 2. Item 2 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 Adding an inline image to an ordered list A common pattern in documentation is adding images throughout ordered lists to help guide users with screenshots or diagrams. Let's say we want to add an image below the second item in our ordered list. In order to accomplish this in GitBook, on the row below the image you would type 3. and then hit space , and the ordered list would continue. Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Task lists Add a task list to a page, then check off the tasks as you complete them — perfect for to-dos. Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes that you can check or uncheck. This is useful for tracking project items, creating playbooks and more. Note: Readers of your published space will not be able to check or uncheck these boxes. You can decide which boxes are checked and unchecked when you create the content. Example of a task list Here’s a task that hasn’t been done Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using Tab . Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done. Finally, an item, unindented using shift + tab . Representation in markdown Copy - [ ] Here’s a task that hasn’t been done - [ x ] Here’s a subtask that has been done, indented using `tab` - [ ] Here’s a subtask that hasn’t been done. - [ ] Finally, an item, unidented using `shift` + `tab` . Hints Add a hint to a page to draw your reader’s attention to specific pieces of important information. Quotes Add a quote block to a page to highlight copy you’re adding from elsewhere, or to draw attention to a specific part of your text. Quotes are useful when you want to include something from another source. Start a quote by typing > followed by pressing Space in an empty paragraph, or use the insert palette . You can also convert a paragraph block to a quote by highlighting the entire paragraph and hitting > . Example of a quote \"No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human.\" — Heraclitus Representation in Markdown Copy Copy > \"No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human.\" — _Heraclitus_ Code blocks Add a code block to a page to include sample code, configurations, code snippets and more. You can add code to your GitBook pages using code blocks. When you add a code block, you can choose to set the syntax , show line numbers , show a caption , and wrap the lines . It’s also easy to copy the contents of a code block to the clipboard , so you can use it elsewhere A code block may be useful for: Sharing configurations Adding code snippets Sharing code files Showing usage examples of command line utilities Showing how to call API endpoints And much more! Example of a code block index.js Copy ‌ import * as React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' ; import App from './App' ; ReactDOM .render (< App /> , window . document .getElementById ( 'root' )); You can also combine code blocks with a tabs block to offer the same code example in multiple different languages: JavaScript Ruby Elixir Copy let greeting = function (name) { console .log ( `Hello, ${ name } !` ); }; }; greeting ( \"Anna\" ); Copy greeting = lambda { | name | puts \"Hello, #{name} !\" } greeting . ( \"Anna\" ) Copy greeting = fn name -> IO . puts ( \"Hello, #{name} !\" ) end greeting . ( \"Anna\" ) Code block options Set syntax… You can set the syntax in your code block to any of the supported languages. This will enable syntax highlighting in that language, too. We use Prism for syntax highlighting. You can use Test Drive Prism to check which languages Prism supports. If you notice a mismatch between GitBook and Prism, there’s a chance we’re a version or two behind. We’ll catch up soon! Copy // Some code With line numbers This will toggle line numbers for your code on and off. Showing line numbers is useful when the code represents the contents of a file as a whole, or when you have long code blocks with lots of lines. Hiding line numbers is useful for snippets, usage instructions for command line or terminal expressions and similar scenarios. With caption This will toggle a caption that sits at the top of the block, above your lines of code. The caption is often the name of a file as shown in our example above , but you can also use it as a title, description, or anything else you’d like. Wrap code This will toggle code wrapping on and off, so long lines of code will wrap to all be visible on the page at once. Wrapping lines is useful when your code is long and you want to avoid having the viewer scroll back and forth to read it. If you toggle Wrap code on, you may also want to show line numbers — this will make it easier to read the code and understand where new lines start. Actions As well as the options above, you can also change the language the code block displays, and copy your code instantly. Copy the code Hover over a code block and a number of icons will appear. Click the middle icon to copy the contents of the code block to your clipboard in one click. Representation in Markdown Copy {% code title=\"index.js\" overflow=\"wrap\" lineNumbers=\"true\" %} ```javascript ‌ import * as React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' ; import App from './App' ; ReactDOM .render (< App /> , window . document .getElementById ( 'root' )); ``` {% endcode %} Files Add a PDF, OpenAPI file and more to your page — plus learn how to manage all your files in GitBook. Images Add an image block to a page. Embedded URLs Embed content directly into your page with a URL — including videos, music and interactive blocks. Tables Keep information organized and make documenting data easier by adding a table to your page. Cards Display information more dynamically with a set of cards — with or without images. Tabs Add a block with multiple tabs to a page, so you can display large blocks of related information without creating a long, hard-to-navigate page. Expandable sections Add an expandable block to a page to keep your pages shorter, hide longer content, or create FAQs Expandable blocks are helpful in condensing what could otherwise be a lengthy paragraph. They are also great in step-by-step guides and FAQs. Example Step 1: Start using expandable blocks To add an expandable block hit / on an empty block, or click the + on the left of the editor, and select Expandable . Step 2: Add content to your block Once you’ve inserted an expandable block, you can add content to it — including lists and code blocks. Representation in Markdown Copy # Expandable blocks <details> <summary>Expandable block</summary> </details> Limitations There are some limitations on which blocks you can create inside of an expandable block. You can check the full list by starting a new line in an expandable block and pressing / to bring up the insert palette. Stepper Stepper blocks let you break down a tutorial or guide into separate, but clearly linked steps. Each step can contain multiple different blocks, allowing you to add detailed information. Example 1 Add a stepper block To add a stepper block, hit / on an empty line or click the + on the left of the editor and select Stepper from the insert menu. 2 Add some content Once you’ve inserted your stepper block, you can start adding content to it — including code blocks, drawings, images and much more. 3 Add more steps Click the + below the step numbers or hit Enter twice to add another step to your stepper block. You can remove or change the style of the step header or step body if you wish. Representation in Markdown Copy ## Example {% stepper %} {% step %} ### Step 1 title Step 1 text {% endstep %} {% step %} ### Step 2 title Step 2 text {% endstep %} {% endstepper %} Limitations There are some limitations on which blocks you can create inside of a stepper block — for example, you cannot add expandable blocks or another stepper block. See all the blocks you can add by starting a new line within a stepper block and pressing / to bring up the insert palette. Drawings Create drawings within GitBook and add them to your page — perfect for diagramming and sketching out quick ideas. Math & TeX Add a mathTeX block to a page when you want to display a mathematical formula in your documentation. You can use the mathTeX format to include mathematical formulae in your documentation. We offer this through the KaTeX library. You can also add mathTeX as inline content . Example of Math & TeX block s = 1 N − 1 ∑ i = 1 N ( x i − x ‾ ) 2 ) 2 s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} s = N − 1 1 ​ i = 1 ∑ N ​ ( x i ​ − x ) 2 ​ Representation in Markdown f ( x ) = x ∗ x ∗ e 2 p i i ξ x f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \\xi x} f ( x ) = x ∗ e 2 p ii ξ x Copy # Math and TeX block $$f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \\xi x}$$ OpenAPI methods Add an OpenAPI spec to a page. You can sync with an OpenAPI or Swagger file or URL to include auto-generated methods in your documentation. After adding your OpenAPI specification to GitBook, you’ll see a condensed version of the API block in the in-app editor. We’re working on consolidating both the in-app editor view and the published content view. Test it (powered by Scalar) GitBook's OpenAPI block also supports a \"try it\" functionality, which allows your users to test your API methods with data and parameters filled in from the editor. Powered by Scalar , you won't need to leave the docs in order to see your API methods in action. See and example of this below. Example of an OpenAPI block Manually writing documentation for your REST API can be time-consuming. To help, GitBook supports OpenAPI document imports, which describe your API, and provides API blocks. These will automatically represent your API methods based on the specification you provide — either as a file or as a URL for GitBook to load. GitBook supports Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 compliant files. Options GitBook supports extra options you can define in your OpenAPI specification to alter they way your API methods display in your published documentation. Property Values Description x-hideTryItPanel true | false | false Show or hide the \"Test it\" button for an OpenAPI block. x-codeSamples true | false Show or hide code samples for an OpenAPI block. Both properties can be set on either the root level or on a per-operation basis. Root Copy x-hideTryItPanel : true x-codeSamples : false paths : /user get : summary : Get the current user Operation Copy paths : /user get : summary : Get the current user x-hideTryItPanel : true x-codeSamples : - lang : javascript label : JS source : console.log('Hello') Create OpenAPI block using your OpenAPI file Once you have an OpenAPI compliant representation of your API, you can use it in your documentation. Create a new OpenAPI block using the insert palette. Add your OpenAPI specification, choosing between one of the following options : Upload your OpenAPI formatted file Provide a URL to your publicly available OpenAPI file. If you’re providing a URL , make sure that the file is available on the open internet, and that it’s not behind any kind of password protection. If you’re just experimenting, you can use one of the default Swagger files : https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json Choose your API operation To change the operation that your swagger block is showing, use the \"Choose API Operation\" option in the block menu Show more than one operation Your API is likely to have more than one operation that you'll want to document. Each OpenAPI block shows one API operation. In order to show multiple API operations, you can create an extra OpenAPI block per operation, backed by the same OpenAPI specification file. Update your specification Update your specification From time to time you might need to update or modify your API specification. In GitBook, you can replace the specification underlying your OpenAPI blocks, and have the update be reflected across all your documentation. Replacing a specification in a file Using the Block context menu on one of your OpenAPI Blocks, select \"Choose OpenAPI Source\" On your OpenAPI file in the file list, click \"Replace\" Once the OpenAPI Source has been replaced, each OpenAPI block that references your file will be updated based on your new specification. Replacing a specification from a link Using the Block context menu on one of your OpenAPI Blocks, select \"Choose OpenAPI Source\" Provide a new URL in the input box, and save Once the OpenAPI Source has been replaced, each OpenAPI block that references your file will be updated based on your new specification. API method block (deprecated) Editable API method blocks are now deprecated In light of our updated OpenAPI method block, we’ve decided to deprecate the API method block. Read our recent announcement to find out more about the reasons behind this change. On Monday 4 March 2024 , we automatically transitioned all pre-existing API method blocks to regular blocks in the format you can see below. Read our announcement to find out more. You can still create editable API references from the Quickstart section of the Insert menu . Hit / on your keyboard and select API Reference . GitBook will create an editable section that looks like this: Create a new user POST /users <Description of the endpoint> Headers Name Value Content-Type application/json Authorization Bearer <token> Body Name Type Description name string Name of the user age number Age of the user Response Response 200 400 Copy { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"John\" , \"age\" : 30 } Copy { \"error\" : \"Invalid request\" } Support for CI/CD with API blocks How to use GitBook’s OpenAPI method blocks to support a CI/CD workflow Our OpenAPI block supports CI/CD, which means your API documentation can auto-update when a new version is released. The method of updating depends on whether you upload your API spec via URL or as a file. URL upload If you upload your API spec via a URL, your docs will auto-update existing API references when they change in the spec. However, when the OpenAPI file is changed, the cache will not be updated immediately. It may take a few hours for the published docs to reflect the latest version, but it can take up to a day. For example, this is the method we use in our developer docs. API file upload API file upload If you upload your API spec as a file, you will have to re-upload the new version of the file in order to update your documentation. However, GitBook will detect existing blocks on the same page and auto-update them when you upload the file. An alternative solution is to use Git Sync with an OpenAPI spec file in the synced repository. Store the OpenAPI spec in a repository as a JSON/YAML file and reference it in Markdown: Copy {% swagger src=\"./openapi.json\" path=\"/collections/{collectionId}\" method=\"get\" expanded=\"true\" %} [ openapi.json ](./openapi.json) {% endswagger %} Every time this file changes and a commit is pushed to GitHub, your docs will also update. This ensures that your documentation is always up to date with your latest API changes. Page links Add a page link block to show relations between pages in your space — and to highlight an important link on your page Page link blocks are the best way create relations between different pages within your content. Page links stand out on the page as they fill their own block — compared to a hyperlink added to some text. Example of page link block The links below point to blocks and inline content : Blocks Inline content Representation in Markdown Copy {% content-ref url=\"./\" %} . {% endcontent-ref %} Reusable content blocks (beta) Turn a set of blocks into a single reusable block that you can add to multiple pages and update all at once Broken links Find and replace broken relative links across your spaces. This feature is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, visit our pricing page . Broken links panel You can add a few different types of links to your pages in GitBook. If someone has broken a relative link while making a change request by updating it or changing its location, you’ll see a notification letting you know there’s something to fix. Broken link detection currently works only for relative links to other GitBook content in your organization. It will not detect broken links to external URLs. To view broken links, click the broken link symbol in the space sub-nav space sub-nav when inside a change request. Product Demo How to fix a broken link If GitBook finds a broken link, you’ll see a notification in this section with a link to the page that includes the broken link. Then, simply replace or update the link with a valid one. As you view your broken links, you can also set the scope and filter of broken links inside of the sidebar: Filter your broken links, or set the scope of the scan. Scope Current change request This will find newly broken links within the scope of the current change request you are working in. Current space This will find broken links within the scope of the current space you are in. Filter by Broken links Broken links Show any broken or missing links in the space or change request you are in. Internal links This filter is useful for making sure your published docs don’t link to internal content within your GitBook organization. It’ll show any links to internal, unpublished content that readers of your published content won’t have access to (i.e. links that start app.gitbook.com/o/<organizationID>/… ). You can fix them by replacing the links with the URL of the published GitBook page. Searching content Find what you’re looking for faster with keyword search and AI-powered smart search. GitBook AI GitBook uses AI to help you find the knowledge you need, faster. Search & Quick find Search and navigate your documentation fast with quick find. Version control Keep track of changes, roll back to a previous version, and more. Overview Publish and share your content with internal or external audiences. Publish a docs site Public publishing Publish your docs publicly to the web so that everyone can access them. If you created your docs for a public audience, you can publish it on the web. Spaces that you publish on the web can be indexed by search engines and will be available to anyone. If you don’t want your content to be indexed by search engines, you can disable that too — read more about that below . However you publish your content, you’ll still retain control over who can edit your content. And only your primary content branch will be published, so any change requests will remain private until merged. Publish as public Publish as public To publish your docs publicly on the web head to the docs site you want to publish, click Publish button, and choose the Public option. Publish without search engine indexing By default, your site will be indexed by search engines. You can alternatively choose to disable this — meaning the docs are still available to everyone on the web, but they won’t be indexed by search engines such as Google. They will still be accessible to anyone with a the link to your documentation. Docs sites that aren’t indexed can be particularly helpful if you want to publish a beta version of your docs, or do large-scale user testing without impacting your SEO with potentially duplicate content. This feature is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, visit our pricing page . Private publishing with share links Share links give you greater control over who can view your published GitBook documentation. This feature is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, visit our pricing page . You can share you content privately with customers or partners without needing to invite them to your organization by using secret links. Publish with share links To publish your docs privately, head to the docs site’s settings, click Audience settings button, and choose the Share links option. Next, click on Create link Create link to create a share link. You can review and name your share links, customize your domain and copy the link. Once the link is active, a private token is generated within your URL, which is unique to your space. Sharing this link will give non-GitBook users access to your content in read mode only, with an interface that looks like any other published content. You can generate as many links as you need from Audience settings . You can revoked and regenerate share links at any time. Access and permissions The content will be accessible to anyone following the link . Your team members can access your content from the Docs sites Docs sites section of the sidebar, or by navigating to the space directly. Revoke a link You can disable or regenerate your shareable by revoking it. You can see and revoke any previously generated link by opening the visibility menu and clicking through to link and domain settings. Once you revoke a link, anyone with that outdated link to your content will no longer have access. Visitor authentication Set up custom authentication for your published content. This feature is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, visit our pricing page . Visitor authentication allows you to publish your content while requiring authentication from any visitors who want to view it. When enabled, GitBook lets your authentication provider handle who has access to the content. Use cases Common use cases for visitor authentication include: Publishing sensitive product documentation that should only be accessible to paying customers, sales prospects or partners. Publishing internal knowledge base content that should only be accessible to employees of your company. Setting up visitor authentication There are two methods you can choose from when setting up visitor authentication: Installing one of our authentication integrations — we currently support Okta, Azure, and Auth0. We highly recommend this option if you’re using an authentication provider we support. Create and host your own server to handle the authentication. Many different technologies can be used, but it’s up to you to code and maintain the solution you choose. Read the guides in our developer documentation to learn more. Publish with visitor authentication To publish your docs with visitor authentication, head to the docs site you want to publish, click Publish , and choose the Visitor Authentication option. If you’re using an external service to authenticate your users, follow the guides below to get up and running. How to use Auth0 Integration for Visitor Authentication GitBook Integration Platform Publish as unlisted By default, your site will be indexed by search engines. You can alternatively choose to publish as unlisted — meaning the docs are still available to authorized, but they won’t be indexed by search engines such as Google. Unlisted spaces can be particularly helpful if you want to publish a beta version of your docs, or do large-scale user testing without impacting your SEO with potentially duplicate content. Site structure and navigation Decide how your site is structured to best fit your content. The content on your site comes from spaces in your organization. You can link one or multiple spaces. GitBook will publish each one and take care of navigation between spaces. Content types Linked spaces can serve as one of two different content types, which determine how GitBook treats them in relation to each other and shows them to visitors. Updated site sections are slowly rolling out to users. Hang tight, as you may not have access to this feature at this point. Content variants Publish multiple versions of the same content — ideal for localization, versioning, and more. Premium sites Site sections Site sections Split your site into distinct parts — ideal for multiple products or parts of your organization. Ultimate sites Managing your site structure From your docs site’s dashboard, click the Settings button, then scroll down to Site structure . Here you can see all the content of your site, divided into sections and variants. Your site starts out with a single section with your site's name and a single variant with the space you linked during your site's set-up . Linking a space to your docs site To add a variant, click the Add variant Add variant button in the section you'd like to add to, then choose a space to link. The new variant is then added to the list of variants within the chosen section and will be available to visitors in the variant dropdown on your site. To add a section, click the Add section button underneath the table and choose a space to link as a section. This space will serve as the first (or only) variant within your new section. The new section is then added to the table and will be available to visitors as a tab at the top of your site. When you add a space (as a variant or section), we generate a name and slug for it based on the space's title. Changing a linked space Changing a linked space You can change the name and slug of each of your linked spaces by tapping the Edit button in the table row of the space you'd like to edit. Edit the field(s) you'd like to change, then click the Save button to save. Changing a linked space's slug will change the space's canonical URL, and might result in broken links across your site. To replace a linked space with a different space, click on the More menu in the space's table row and then click Replace linked space . Reordering linked spaces Reordering linked spaces Your site displays linked spaces in the order that they appear in your Site structure table. Spaces can be reordered by grabbing the Drag handle and moving it up or down. Alternatively, you can press the More menu in the table row of the space you'd like to edit and choosing Move up or Move down . The changed order will be reflected on your site immediately. Setting default content Setting default content If you have multiple sections in your site, one section will be marked as the default. This section is shown when visitors arrive on your site, and is served from your site's root URL. Other sections each have a slug that is appended to the root URL. If you have multiple variants within a section, one variant will be marked as the default. Like sections, the default variant is shown when visitors arrive on your site (or when they visit a section). Other variants each have a slug that is appended to the section's URL. To set a space as default, click on the More menu in the space's table row and then click Set as default . . Setting a space as default removes its slug field, as it will be served from the section root instead. We will redirect the space's slug to the appropriate path, to ensure visitors keep seeing your content. Remove content from a site To remove the content of a space from a site, click the Settings button from your docs site dashboard, then scroll down to the Site structure section to find the content you want to remove. Open the More menu next to the linked space you want to remove and select Delete from site . This will remove it from the published site, but will not delete the space or the content within. Content variants Publish multiple versions of your documentation in a single site — ideal for language localization, product versions, and more. You can publish multiple versions of the same documentation as part of a single docs site. These variations will be available to the end users via the space switcher in the top-left corner of the published site. Why publish multiple spaces on one site? A site with multiple spaces is useful if you need to group together the content of your spaces — such as if you’re documenting multiple versions of an API (v1, v2, v3, etc.), or documenting your content in different languages. The spaces you link can contain any content, but it is recommended to use variants as variations of the same content variations of the same content . If the spaces you link are semantically different from each other, consider adding them as site sections instead. Adding a variant to your docs site To add a variant, click the Add variant button in the section you'd like to add to, then choose a space to link. The new variant is then added to the list of variants within the chosen section and will be available to visitors in the variant dropdown on your site. Changing a variant Changing a linked space's slug will change the space's canonical URL, and might result in broken links across your site. Reordering variants Setting a default variant Setting a default variant If you have multiple variants within a section, one variant will be marked as the default. This variant is shown when visitors arrive on your site (or when they visit a section). Other variants each have a slug that is appended to the site's URL. Setting a space as default removes its slug field, as it will be served from the section root instead. We will redirect the space's slug to the appropriate path, to ensure visitors keep seeing your content. Remove a variant from a site Site sections Split your site into distinct parts — ideal for multiple products or different parts of your organization. Customization Change the look and feel of your published docs site by adding a custom logo, changing theme colors and personalizing the footer to align your site with your brand. You can customize the appearance of your published documentation, match the user interface to the language of your content, and more. You can apply customizations to your entire docs site as a site-wide theme, or to individual variations using overrides. Permissions Admins and creators in a space published as part of a docs site can edit customization settings.

Set a custom domain Learn how to set a custom domain for your GitBook organization or Docs sites 1. Choose a subdomain and its location 2. Initiate the custom domain set-up 3. Configure the DNS 4. Finalize the custom domain setup Troubleshooting custom domain setup Helping you to solve some of the most common issues when setting up a custom domain. Setting up a custom domain can occasionally run into obstacles. Below, we outline frequent problems encountered during this process and provide detailed solutions to each of them. SSL error: an error occurred when provisioning your SSL certificate. When a custom domain is set for your organization, collection, or space, we set up an SSL certificate on our end so that your documentation will load securely, over HTTPS. This happens automatically when you set your custom domain — you do not need to purchase or configure an SSL certificate. Occasionally errors occur at this stage, usually when the CNAME record for the custom domain hasn't propagated. In these cases, we can recommend the following: Check that your CNAME record is set up correctly. Please review our page about configuring DNS to help you with this. If the CNAME record is incorrect, we won't be able to configure the SSL certificate and complete the custom domain set-up. Allow at least one hour between configuring the CNAME record and finalizing the custom domain setup finalizing the custom domain setup . Verify if the CNAME has propagated. You can try using a third-party DNS lookup tool, such as WhatsMyDNS , to find out what the servers believe to be correct for your correct CNAME record. If you are using Cloudflare, please confirm that you don’t have the record proxied as explained here . Domain already connected error: your subdomain is already configured for different content. A custom domain assigned to an organization or site must be unique. Attempting to use the same custom domain in more than one location will result in an error. If this happens, you can click the link within the error message to look at the content the custom domain is already connected to. This may help you to decide what to do next. It’s also possible that you might not have access to the content — if that’s the case, contact the support team and they can help you with your next steps. The solution to this error will always be one of two things, however: Choose a different custom domain; or Disconnect the custom domain from the content it is already connected to, then reconnect it to the new content. The custom domain is set correctly, but is redirecting to a different custom domain. This is an expected behaviour, that usually can be changed. The common issue is that custom domains have been set in multiple locations for example organization and the site. When someone accesses the URL for an organization, they are taken straight to the organization’s default content. Likewise, when someone accesses the URL for a multi-variant site, they are taken straight to the multi-variant default site. Example docs.example.com is set as the custom domain for an organization team.example.com is set as the custom domain for that organization’s default content. In this case, the expected behaviour would be docs.example.com redirecting you to team.example.com . . This issue can be solved by changing the default content or by removing the organization domain and adding the domains at a space level or the other way around (removing the space domain, and maintaining the org domain) This issue frequently occurs due to the confusion over the location of the domain. Please ensure you checked where your domains are set up, and adjusted this to your requirement. Contact the support team if you are still experiencing an issue. In your message, please make sure to share: The subdomain that you would like to set as a custom domain The organization or site name for which you would like to set it. Site insights Site settings See which settings you can update across your published site. SEO Optimize your GitBook documentation to be discoverable via search engines. Thanks to the following features, your GitBook projects are SEO-friendly with little or no configuration on your end: Responsive design All content is suitable for mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktops! The design for your published documentation will adapt based on the size of the device it is being viewed on. SEO-friendly content URLs are set based on each page’s title by default, but can be customized as you wish. We avoid duplicate content through smart, canonical URLs. The HTML title and Open Graph title are based on the page and space title. The meta description and Open Graph description are based on the page description. Alt text can be added to images, which is also very important for accessibility. HTML sent to crawlers is pre-rendered (i.e. server-side), meaning that crawlers do not need JavaScript to index your content. Note that we don’t generate keyword meta tags, because modern search engines do not use them to rank pages. This was officially confirmed by Google in 2009. Sitemap Provided that your space is published with a setting other than unlisted , we automatically generate a sitemap.xml file based on your table of contents table of contents . You can locate this by going to the first page of your documentation and then appending /sitemap.xml to the URL. For example, the first page of our documentation is located at docs.gitbook.com , and so our sitemap.xml file is located at docs.gitbook.com/sitemap.xml . Custom domain If you prefer, you can set a custom domain for your documentation. (e.g. docs.example.com instead of yourorganization.gitbook.io ) Caching & CDN Caching & CDN All published content is cached and served via our global CDN (content delivery network). This helps to improve performance, which is an important factor within SEO. Even with these great features, it could still take some time before your documentation is indexed by Google (and other search engines). Both we and you have no direct control over this, but there are two things that you could do to help improve the chance of getting your content indexed more quickly: Make sure that there are links to your GitBook space from other websites that have already been indexed by Google. As Google will return to re-index these sites from time to time, this increases the chance that they’ll find your space as a result of re-indexing one of these other sites. Try submitting your site to Google submitting your site to Google , which essentially asks them to index it. For GitBook spaces, this will only be possible if you are using a custom domain for your space and if you create a TXT DNS record to confirm ownership of the domain. Redirects Moving your content to GitBook or changing its structure? Broken links can impact your SEO. Read how to set up redirects in GitBook (via Git sync) . Overview Connect your GitBook spaces to your favorite collaboration tools & analytics platform Install and manage integrations How to install an integration in a single space, or all the spaces in your organization — and manage its settings Slack (beta) The GitBook integration for Slack lets you curate knowledge into your knowledge base, right from the source The GitBook Slack integration helps you collect, review, and share information to and from your company’s knowledge base. With a set of commands you can run within your Slack Workspace, it’s easy to add or use information that’s useful for your team. GitBook AI will summarize information that you or your team add to your knowledge base, turning a series of messages into a context-rich document.

GitBook AI & the Slack integration are available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, visit our pricing page . Installation & Configuration You can install the Slack integration right from the integrations page in GitBook. After installing the Slack integration to GitBook, you’ll see a prompt to authorize your user account and install the Slack bot into your organization’s Slack workspace. After installing the integration into your Slack workspace, you can use the included Slack commands, or invite the GitBook Slack bot to the channels you’d like to interact with it in, and tag it to ask a question. See the FAQs at the bottom to learn more about where you can use the GitBook Slack bot. You need to be a You need to be a workspace owner or workspace admin in Slack to install the GitBook Slack bot into your team’s workspace. If you had installed the GitBook Slack integration prior to October 7th 2023, you’ll need to uninstall and reinstall the integration to get the latest version. Adding information to your knowledge base You can add information to your team’s knowledge base by calling the GitBook Slack bot. You can invoke the bot in different ways, in both public or private channels. How to add information using the GitBook Slack bot Calling @GitBook save from within thread will summarize context and data from that thread into your team’s knowledge base as a snippet a snippet . Calling the GitBook bot will work from any thread within a public channel or private channel. In a private channel, make sure to invite the GitBook bot in order for it to work. How to add information using the Slack shortcut You can also add data to your team’s knowledge base using Slack shortcuts. Simply click the More actions button from a thread in Slack, click More message shortcuts… , and search for the GitBook bot. You can call the shortcut from any message in a thread — the GitBook bot will save the entire thread. How to summon GitBook knowledge within Slack As well as saving information to your team’s knowledge base, you can also recall anything from your knowledge base from within Slack, while you work. Using the GitBook Slack command Calling /gitbook [question] will allow you to get a private , AI-generated response to your question, based on the information in your team’s knowledge base. The answer in Slack will only be visible to you — which is useful if you need a quick bit of context on something without polluting your team’s channel. After GitBook returns your answer, you’ll have the option to share your answer to the channel, if you think the answer is helpful for others. The Slack command will only work in public channels, private channels, and direct messages. It will not work inside of a thread. Using the GitBook Slack bot You can call the GitBook Slack bot directly with @GitBook [question] to receive a public answer in any channel or thread. After asking your question in a channel or thread, everyone that has access to that channel will be able to see it and the answer. Calling the GitBook Slack bot will only work in public channels, private channels, and threads. It will not work inside of a direct message. Messaging the GitBook Slack bot directly You can also ask questions to the GitBook Slack bot in a direct message. After starting a direct message with the GitBook Slack bot, simply ask your question. GitBook AI will generate and return an answer privately in seconds. FAQs Why isn’t the /gitbook [question] or @GitBook save command working in Slack? When interacting with the GitBook Slack integration, there are a few things to keep in mind: The /gitbook [question] command does not work in threads. It will only work in public and private channels or direct messages. The @GitBook save @GitBook save command does not work in top-level channels or direct messages. It will only work inside threads in public or private channels. How do permissions work with the Slack integration? The Slack integration does not take into account individual user permissions in GitBook. This is because there is no direct link or tie between a Slack user and a GitBook user. However, when you set up the Slack integration you can specify which spaces it has access to, which can help mitigate any security risks if you have sensitive content. GitHub Copilot GitHub & GitLab Sync Synchronize your GitBook content with GitHub or GitLab with GitBook’s bi-directional integration. Enabling GitHub Sync How to set up and authorize the GitHub Sync integration for GitBook. Enabling GitLab Sync How to set up and authorize the GitLab Sync integration for GitBook. Content configuration If you’d like to configure GitSync further, you can add a .gitbook.yaml file at the root of your repository to tell GitBook how to parse your Git repository. Here’s an example: .gitbook.yaml Copy root : ./ ​structure : readme : README.md summary : SUMMARY.md​ redirects : previous/page : new-folder/page.md Root The path to lookup for your documentation defaults to the root directory of the repository. Here’s how you can tell GitBook to look into a ./docs folder: .gitbook.yaml Copy root : ./docs/ All other options that specify paths will be relative to this root folder . So if you define root as ./docs/ and then structure.summary as ./product/SUMMARY.md , GitBook will actually look for a file in ./docs/product/SUMMARY.md .‌ ​Structure‌ The structure accepts two properties:‌ readme : Your documentation’s first page. Its default value is ./README.md summary : Your documentation’s table of content. Its default value is ./SUMMARY.md The value of those properties is a path to the corresponding files. The path is relative to the “root” option. For example, here’s how you can tell GitBook to look into a ./product folder for the first page and summary: .gitbook.yaml Copy structure Copy structure : readme : ./product/README.md summary : ./product/SUMMARY.md ​Summary‌ The summary file is a Markdown file ( .md ) that should have the following structure: Copy ‌# Summary​ ## Use headings to create page groups like this one​ * [First page’s title](page1/README.md) * [Some child page](page1/page1-1.md) * [Some other child page](part1/page1-2.md) * [Second page’s title](page2/README.md) * [Some child page](page2/page2-1.md) * [Some other child page](part2/page2-2.md) ## A second-page group​ * [Yet another page](another-page.md) Providing a custom summary file is optional. By default, GitBook will look for a file named SUMMARY.md in your root folder if specified in your config file, or at the root of the repository otherwise. If you don’t specify a summary, and GitBook does not find a SUMMARY.md file at the root of your docs, GitBook will infer the table of contents from the folder structure and the Markdown files below.‌ The summary markdown file is a mirror of the table of contents table of contents of your GitBook space. So even when no summary file is provided during an initial import, GitBook will create one and/or update it whenever you update your content using the GitBook editor. Because of this, it’s not possible to reference the same Markdown file twice in your SUMMARY.md file, because this would imply that a single page lives at two different URLs in your GitBook space. ​Redirects Redirects are commonly used when you are migrating your documentation from one provider to another — like when you just moved your docs to GitBook. Broken links can impact your SEO so we recommend setting up redirects where needed. Restructuring your content in GitBook When moving your content within GitBook, most URLs should work as expected depending on complexity of the change. There are a number of tools that will allow you to verify which links were broken, if any. With Git, when a file is moved many times, the file is removed and a new one is created. This makes it impossible for GitBook to know that a folder has been renamed, for example. Make sure to double-check and add redirects where needed. How to create a redirect You can create custom redirects of a URL to a page by specifying the path to the corresponding file. The path is relative to the “root” option. For example, here’s how you can tell GitBook to redirect users accessing a past url /help to a new url /support .gitbook.yaml Copy Copy root : ./ redirects : help : support.md How to redirect on a more complex path: Original URL: https://docs.company.com/help which has now moved to https://docs.company.com/misc/support on GitBook. .gitbook.yaml Copy root : ./ redirects : help : misc/support.md The path misc/support.md needs to be a real existing path within the repository. It needs to be relative to the current root setting in .gitbook.yaml . Please don’t add any leading slashes. For example, ./misc/support.md will not work. Troubleshooting The YAML file needs to be correctly formatted for the redirects to work. Errors such as incorrect indentation or whitespace can result in your redirects not working. Validating your YAML file Validating your YAML file can ensure that the redirects will work smoothly. It's also important to consider that as long as a page exists for a path, GitBook won’t be looking for a possible redirect. So if you're setting up a redirect for an old page to a new one, you will need to remove the old page in order for the redirect to work. GitHub pull request preview Commit messages & Autolink Monorepos GitBook supports monorepos. A monorepo is a repository that contains more than one logical project (e.g. an iOS client and a web application). GitBook can synchronize multiple directories from the same repository with multiple spaces. When enabling Git Sync on a space, you can configure a \"Project directory\". It will be used to lookup the .gitbook.yaml file for the directory to synchronize with this space. Example of a repository structure: Copy / package.json packages/ styleguide/ .gitbook.yaml README.md SUMMARY.md app/ README.md SUMMARY.md api/ .gitbook.yaml README.md SUMMARY.md In this example, 3 spaces can be created on GitBook and configured with different Root directories: packages/styleguide packages/app packages/api The \"Project directory\" option at the Git Sync level differs from the root option in the .gitbook.yaml configuration file. The first is used to lookup .gitbook.yaml itself, then both are combined to lookup the rest of the files in the directory. If no .gitbook.yaml exists in the \"Project directory\", the synchronization will use the default configuration scoped to this directory. Updating the Project directory In most cases, we recommend the following step to update the Project directory: Disable the existing Git Sync Move the files in the Git repository to the Project directory Reconfigure the Git Sync with the new Project directory In some cases, you might have started with a typical repository synchronizing with only one space, but then decided to transition into a monorepo with multiple spaces synchronizing with it; or might have to rename the Project directory. Changing the Project directory on an existing Git Sync can have an unexpected impact on the content, the change will only be propagated during the next synchronization (edit made on GitBook or new commit in the Git repository). If the next operation is an import from the Git repository : : GitBook will expect to find the pages and files in the Project directory. If the files have not already been moved into the repository’s Project directory, the result of the synchronization would be an empty space with no content. We recommend having the next operation to be a commit moving all GitBook-related files (markdown files, README/SUMMARY, and assets) in the repository to their correct new location, in the Project directory. If the next operation is an export from GitBook to the Git repository : GitBook will generate or update new files in the new Project directory. Files synchronized with GitBook will be moved to the new Project directory (with the best attempt); it might cause side effects if other parts of your system depend on these files. Troubleshooting I have a GitHub sync error In case of errors, make sure that:‌ Your repository has a README.md file at its root (or at the root folder specified in your .gitbook.yaml ). This file is required and is used as the homepage for your documentation. For more details, refer to our content configuration . If you have YAML frontmatters in your Markdown files, make sure they are valid using a linter .​ ​GitBook is not using my docs folder docs folder By default, GitBook uses the root of the repository as a starting point. A specific directory can be specified to scope the markdown files. Take a look at our documentation on content configuration for more details.‌ GitBook is creating new markdown files When synchronizing and editing from GitBook with an existing Git repository, GitBook may create new markdown files instead of using the existing ones.‌ This is done to ensure GitBook doesn't overrite files that existed in your repository before. ​My repository is not listed For GitHub repositories For GitHub repositories Make sure that you have installed the GitBook GitHub app to the correct locations (when installing the app, you can choose to install it to your personal GitHub, or to any organization you have permissions for) and that you have given the app the correct repository permissions. For GitLab repositories Make sure that your access token has been configured with the following access: api read_repository write_repository ​Nothing happens on GitBook after adding a new file to my repository This section specifically addresses problems when a SUMMARY.md file already exists If your repository does not include a SUMMARY.md SUMMARY.md file, GitBook will automatically create one upon the first sync. This means that if you edited your content from GitBook at least once after setting up Git sync, GitBook should have created this file automatically.‌ If after updating your repository by adding or modifying a markdown file, you do not see the update reflected on GitBook and the sidebar doesn’t indicate an error during the sync, your modified file(s) is probably not listed in your SUMMARY.md file .‌ This could either be because you created the file manually, or because you made an edit on GitBook and the GitBook to Git export phase of the sync created it for you. The content of this file mirrors your table of contents table of contents on GitBook and is used during the Git to GitBook import phase of the sync to recreate your table of contents and re-conciliate upcoming updates from the repository with your existing content on GitBook.‌ If after ensuring that all your files are included in the SUMMARY.md file there’s still nothing happening on GitBook, don’t hesitate to contact support for assistance. GitHub preview is not showing If your GitHub preview is not showing, it might be because your GitSync integration was configured before January 2022. Versions of GitSync configured before this date do not include GitHub Preview. You should have received a notification requesting you to accept an updated permission request to enable read-only access to PRs. In case you did not receive the notification, to troubleshoot you need to update to the new version: Uninstall the GitSync integration from your organization. Reinstall the new version with the updated permissions. Please note that uninstalling the GitSync integration will require reconfiguring the integration again on any spaces it was previously connected to. Potential duplicated accounts when signing in This error usually occurs when the GitHub account that you use to set up the sync is already associated with a different GitBook user account. A good way to identify which GitBook account the GitHub account is already linked to is: Log out from your current GitBook user session (i.e. name@email.com ) Log out from any GitHub user sessions. Go to the Log in page . Select the \"Sign in with GitHub\" option. Enter your GitHub credentials. Once logged in, go to the account settings and either: Unlink the account from the \"Third-party Login > GitHub\" section in the Personal setting Delete the account altogether if you do not need it. Log out from the session. Log back in using your name@email.com GitBook account. Try to set up Git Sync again.

Include the link to your organization. Finding this link is described in step 3 of the section above. If you have any questions, feel free to contact our support team . Billing policy We keep things fair by billing based on plan usage: You’ll be charged based on the number of members in your organization on the day that you upgrade to a paid plan, and on each day that the plan renews, either monthly or yearly. You can make changes to the number of members in the organization at any time, and those changes will be reflected in your next bill on a prorated basis, whether you pay monthly or yearly. The one exception to the above is if you have chosen an annual plan and your changes result in a balance of over $240 on the Plus plan or over $450 on the Pro plan. (For customers on our legacy plans, this would apply for a balance of over $300 on the Team plan or over $1000 on the Business plan.) If your balance exceeds the relevant amount, we will process a payment for the changes immediately. We also encourage you to familiarise yourself with our terms of service . In particular, you may like to review the section about payment . Pro rata pricing example Let’s say that you decide to upgrade to our Pro plan on April 7th , with 6 users in your organization, paying monthly monthly . This means you will pay the per user per month price of $15 x 6 users, plus the platform fee of $99 per month. That’s a total of $189 per month . Then, 10 days later on April 17th , let’s say that you add two more members to the organization, bringing the total up to 8 users. A prorated charge for the remainder of the billing period (through until 7th May) will be calculated, and $20 will be added to your May bill as a result. bill as a result. And then, another 10 days later on April 27th , let’s say that you remove one member from the organization, bringing the total down to 7 users. A prorated credit for the remainder of the billing period (through until 7th May) will be calculated, and $5 will be credited to your May bill as a result. So after both of these changes, when the bill comes in May, you should expect to see it made up of three parts: $204 for the current 7 users in the organization for the next billing month, through until June 7th. A A $20 adjustment for the addition of the 7th and 8th organization members in the previous billing month. A -$5 adjustment for the removal of the 8th organization member in the previous billing month. This would result in $219 being the total to pay on May 7th . The prorated subscription cost is calculated by dividing the cost per member ($15 in this case) by the number of days in the month (30) and multiplying it by the number of days remaining. Charges Charges All billing is handled through Stripe. GitBook doesn’t store any sensitive payment information, and you can manage all your billing information through the billing dashboard. There are three occasions on which we’ll charge your payment method on file: On the day that you first upgrade to a paid plan. On the monthly or yearly renewal date of your billing period. (Extra charges apply if you add more members and credit will be applied if you remove members, as explained in the section above.) On any day when your plan’s balance exceeds $240 on the Plus plan or $450 on the Pro plan. Invoices Invoices Your invoice history is available in Stripe, which you can access via the organization’s settings page, by clicking on the billing tab. A summary is shown on the page, and invoices can be downloaded from here by clicking on the date of the invoice.

Organization settings Member management Learn how to manage access to content for members of your organization. Invite or remove members Roles Teams Teams are a great way of grouping members within your organization. Permissions and inheritance SSO & SAML Discover how to share your GitBook content via SSO&SAML. SSO SAML single sign-on SSO Members vs non-SSO Users who have created a GitBook account with an email used in your SAML Identity Provider, or joined your organization prior to the configuration of SAML, might see their login with SSO being blocked with a message prompting them to \" Log in with your existing credentials \": Origin of the message and security considerations The first principle of our SAML SSO implementation is security. If a user account has been created using an email address bob@company.com , and later on Bob attempts to log in with the company SAML, GitBook cannot verify the integrity of the email address returned by the identity provider and thus cannot authenticate them as the current account bob@company.com bob@company.com . To prevent the creation of two accounts associated with the bob@company.com email address, GitBook indicates to the user that they should log in with their original account. The organization administrator, later on, decides how to handle the case : By enabling SSO on a user account, an organization administrator indicates to GitBook that the relationship between the email address of the account and the profile in your SAML Identity Provider can be trusted. Remediations When a user sees their SSO login not succeeding with the message \"Log in with your existing credentials\", actions can be taken by the organization administrator to authorize them. If the user account is already a member of the organization: An organization administrator can enable SSO on your organization membership from the administration dashboard. Next time, the user account will be authorized to login into the organization using the SSO flow. or The user can log in to their account using the credentials initially used to create the account. For example, by clicking on \"Continue with email\" to receive an email sign-in link. ℹ️ SSO login will not be automatically enabled for this user, and an organization administrator has to enable it explicitly from the admin dashboard. If the user account is not yet a member of the organization: An organization administrator should add the user account to the organization by inviting their email address from the admin dashboard. The user account can then directly be enabled for SSO login. Enabling SSO login for members Enabling SSO login for members Organization administrators can enable SSO login for members by linking their accounts to SSO. Doing this indicates to GitBook that the user account can be trusted as being connected to the identity in your provider. FAQ How do I contact support? How do I report bugs?

Content creation FAQ What browsers are supported by GitBook? GitBook supports the current versions of Chrome , Firefox , Safari , and Microsoft Edge . Does GitBook support RTL languages? We have RTL support in mind, but it’s not yet ready. For now, only paragraphs and headings will automatically detect RTL text and adapt its layout. Lists and other content blocks are not aligned properly. Also, you may have noticed a poor font quality being used for your language. Is there a limit on the documentation import size? GitBook currently has the following limits for imported content: The maximum number of pages that can be uploaded in a single import is 20. The maximum number of files (images etc.) that can be uploaded in a single import is 20. How can I export my content? We recommend exporting your content in Markdown format by enabling GitHub or GitLab sync . You can also export your content via PDF but you may hit some limits in case of larger spaces. Can I move a page from one space to another? We do not support moving single pages between spaces at this time. We recommend you copy and paste the content as needed. In cases of larger content reorganization where you will need to move a number of pages between spaces, we recommend you contact our support team who can guide you through moving your content via GitHub or GitLab sync. To easily select multiple blocks you can use block selection mode, which is enabled by hitting the esc key. To copy an entire page of text, you can hit esc to enable block selection and then hit cmd + a to select all content on a page and then copy and paste to a new space. Can I move a space between organizations? Yes, you can! Read more about how to move a space. Can I export my content in Markdown format? We don't have the ability to export pages as Markdown in the GitBook app, but you can sync a space to GitHub or GitLab and generate a markdown export that way. Note that there might be a few exceptions where customized blocks appear as HTML. How do I revert to the previous version of my content? Admins and creators can click the rollback button while viewing a specific history item to roll the space back to this point in time. Do you support offline contributions? Not at the moment!

A guest acts as a standard user in every other regard, they just need to have their permissions set explicitly at a content level.Inviting a guest to the organization means that they’ll only ever see content they’ve been directly added to.
