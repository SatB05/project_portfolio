# Project Debrief
There is a certain Car Market Research company who has accumulated several customer reviews about many cars as presented. The issue the company is facing is they want to auto-send each review to the correct department to address and take corrective measures. Therefore they want to **cluster** these reviews and want to understand what car-related features/parameters each review is about. Can you help them in their pursuit? 

They have manually created a list of Customer Reviews tagged with Departments. You can use that as a reference to benchmark your clustering.
