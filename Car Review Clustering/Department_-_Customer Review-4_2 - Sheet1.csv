"
,,road presence,,"almost everyone on the road turned head to take another glimpse of the car, great road presence for sure. 
"
,,road presence,,and they sure have road presence.
,,road presence,,"the tata harrier is definitely the package of features, equipment, new-age design, best build quality, performance & the great road presence, but however is worth a wait for those looking to purchase a diesel automatic transmission sourced from hyundai and enthusiasts looking for a more punchy 170bhp for power."
,,road presence,,"the hexa has an at and 4×4 option, 2 extra seats and choice of captain seats in the middle (can you imagine how claustrophobic the upcoming 7 seater harrier will be?), sorted niggles, usable orvms while retaining the harriers plus points such as decent road presence, good driveability (if not better), awesome music system, spacious cabin, ground clearance, etc."
,,road presence,,i must say tata harrier has absolutely best road presence.
,,road presence,,harrier has excellent road presence the vehicle sits beautifully at top speeds.
,,road presence,,striking design with a great road presence.
,,road presence,,"the car is good but tata should have worked on the engine of the car as there is bat much pickup in the car in the second gear, but keeping it aside it is a lovely car, and if you are fond of big cars and want to have a good road presence then it is the best car at this price point."

"
,,road presence,,good road presence and amazing built quality.
,,road presence,,other than these it comes with * sportive looks *great road presence *better ride quality *tough built quality *spacious and comfortable rich cabin( in its segment and at that price point )
,,road presence,,"tata harrier is the best car from tata, best road presence, this car can beatcreta, compass, mg hector."
,,road presence,,"the tata harrier is definitely the package of features, equipment, new-age design, best build quality, performance & the great road presence, but however is worth a wait for those looking to purchase a diesel automatictransmission sourced from hyundai and enthusiasts looking for a more punchy 170bhp for power."
,,road presence,,"hector is actually a good product.has some good list of features, tried and tested diesel engine and most importantly has a tempting road presence which every indian car buyer always wants... plus the mg motors ad campaign and promotion was spot on."
,,road presence,,harrier is superbly built and the road presence is unbeatable.
,,road presence,,"best part is that it won’t feel underpowered anywhere. except that ugly orange, grey and gold harrier looks just like range rovers and have undeniable road presence."
,,road presence,,road presence of the car is fabulous...
,,road presence,,"aged so well, with fantastic road presence still, just adequate proportions accommodating 7 seats and all the bells and whistles, i doubt any other mid-sized suv can beat xuv5oo."
,,road presence,,mg hector - front grill helps this car to get an amazing road presence.
,,road presence,,its road presence is too good and it has good safety standards.
,,road presence,,"slightly better equipped than my current 2015 model fortuner
tried and tested, predictable total cost of ownership
good resale
road presence
proper 7 seater not positives:
under equipped for the price
road presence 
it is a fortuner  
2) 5 seater suv creta/compass/seltos/hector
"
,,road presence,,a strong road presence and classy interiors are certainly the best compared to jeep compass and harrier.
,,road presence,,poor quality and road presence.
,,road presence,,saw my first seltos on the road today (i know i'm very late) and i found it to have good enough road presence.
,,road presence,,endeavour is better in road presence  ....
,,road presence,,the seltos somehow doesn't really have the road presence that creta has.
,,road presence,,the creta looked much bigger and had a better road presence imo.
,,road presence,,"i see many posts like this related to road presence.
"
,,road presence,,"so, anyone who wants road presence or second glances from people around should look elsewhere."
,,road presence,,"the hector, harrier and xuv500 are full one size bigger vehicles which will have more road presence."
,,road presence,,it looks smaller than creta and in my honest opinion has very less road presence.
,,road presence,,20 lacs for this vehicle is absurd if we go by sheer road presence.
,,road presence,,"the harrier i feel would still have a play in terms of size, road presence and good interiors."
,,road presence,,it has very weak road presence compared to even a creta.
,,road presence,,"however i was a big fan of xuvs road presence, space and amazing torque/power. 
"
,,road presence,,"and i found the hector to be a great overall package, with a great engine (same as compass) and excellent interior space and good road presence."
,,road presence,,"my family is not much keen on seltos due to the its size, internal space and road presence."
,,road presence,,"provided it is priced around or a bit lower than creta, for that price range it offers lots of bells and whistles, though as many pointed out it does not offer a commanding road presence."
,,road presence,,i'm looking for a car that doesn't have much of road presence.
,,road presence,,i'm looking for a car that doesn't have much of road presence.
,,road presence,,i like the car to be nicely designed but don't care if it doesn't have 'road presence' or more importantly the 'butch looks'.
,,road presence,,people prefer tall suvs (one of the complaint against the seltos is that it is not tall enough) for the 'road presence' but they will be fine with the compromised dynamics and a potentially unstable vehicle.
,,road presence,,"can't agree more! though they are giving all gimmicky features, in the end, indian customer mindset is more inclined towards road presence and price he paid for it!"
,,road presence,,"even the tuscon has hardly any road presence or character if you ask me. which begs the obvious question that i have: what is the justification for the seltos in the 15-20 lakh range when the creta/hector/harrier/xuv/hexa all offer more in terms of engines/space or features in one way or the other? 
the 1.4l petrol with dct is the only one that i would bother with but even that at ~ 18-20lakhs will need a lot of convincing to get. 
"
,,road presence,,"car looks gorgeous and has road presence. 
"
,,road presence,,"well, it's got good road presence."
,,road presence,,road presence is good and looks are quite modern.
,,road presence,,the word 'badass' indicates towards kia seltos that it has great big looking stunning design in a compact form and it has a great road presence which feels badass to be owned.
,,road presence,,super drive quality and awesome road presence.
,,road presence,,has a very good road presence looks even better than many cars on the road and seltos will make you feel like the boss of the road.
,,road presence,,"riding comfort and riding feel is good, but poor mileage, exterior and interior is very good, road presence is very good, service cost is expensive, bad experience in bad roads, interior plastic quality is not good."
,,road presence,,the main pros of xuv is the looks and the road presence
,,road presence,,"i brought xuv500 w11(0) in november 2018 owning a car like xuv500, it's just amazing its road presence"
,,road presence,,"in a market like ours they are able to do this because the consumer has still not fully evolved and prizes automobile real estate and size and 'road presence' more than most other things.  
"
,,road presence,,"more space, much better road presence ( compass wasn't a car that had a lot of road presence actually ) and with some off-road tires and the massive raptor grill thrown in, will blow anything else out of the water.
and the diesel at combo which will make its debut in the trailhawk, will surely push it past 30-32 lacs, and that will be the final nail in the coffin."
,,road presence,,the kind of road presence or feel large vehicles have to offer makes a tough call picking up something smaller.
,,road presence,,"besides poor fuel efficiency no other complaints details about looks, performance etc: excellent road presence, good looks pros and cons: fuel economy"
,,road presence,,"overall, while the road presence is just about right for an suv, the design is a trifle garish for my taste. 
"
,,road presence,,good looking and excellent build qualityand road presence.
,,road presence,,"excellent suv fulfills all need of road presence, offroad capability and comfortable ride."
,,road presence,,"superb car last 10 years

,,build quality,,built quality is good.
,,build quality,,harriers built quality is far better than hector and others as well
,,build quality,,the built quality is best and comparing other with hyundai and other upcoming products they don't justify with the safety built quality....tata always thinks for indian that's why they built heavy vehicle compared with other brands.....proud to be a part of tata cars....since 2000 when we first purchased indica..
,,build quality,,"the looks, the built quality is superb."
,,build quality,,tata built quality is amazing with safety features all functions available in this car.
,,build quality,,"one of the best-built quality provided by the tata, it has a huge space in the interiors for comfort and luxurious interiors, harrier is no doubt a premium suv with a lot of features and worth buying it."
,,build quality,,"the car is roomy and classy built quality, have land rover frame and jeep compass engine, but it shaky in little high speed, don't go gripping the road."
,,build quality,,feel it's good specius car feel like luxury car tata made car very good and built quality is so good just they buy jaguar compony
,,build quality,,the built quality is good and the interior is well equipped.
,,build quality,,fabulous built quality.
,,build quality,,built quality is really good and adds the interior design to it and the car has the potential to become the best car of 2019.

,,build quality,,mg hector is a premium car with a great built quality.
,,build quality,,this car has amazing safety features and strong built quality.
,,build quality,,all in all seltos passes my built quality test fairly.
,,build quality,,their built quality and stability is way more than cars u have reviewed drive a polo or vento u will love it for sure
,,build quality,,"not really impressed with the built quality, exterior look flashy but not robust."
,,build quality,,the petrol variant with turbocharger is ultimate it gives a boom performance to the drive and the built quality is also good ..
,,build quality,,simply not super almost like breeza design n same built quality.
,,build quality,,looks are very good but the built quality is average.
,,build quality,,the built quality of the car is solid with a good pick up power.
,,build quality,,mahindra xuv500 has a very powerful engine but built quality not perfect also other parts like breaking system is very poor.
,,build quality,,"4) compass has higher ground clearance as well and with trailhawk around the corner the difference would increase only. 
safety and built quality wise both should be similar."
,,build quality,,"1) its built quality and exterior is good.
"
,,build quality,,built quality is very solid and a quick peppy engine.
,,build quality,,the built quality is nice.
,,build quality,,"never expected such a marvel from mahindra, they have rocked the market , value for money, excellent build quality, features and remarkable power ."
,,build quality,,"great build quality.
nice music system.
good acceleration and breaking.
for the price"
,,build quality,,build quality is also amazing......
,,build quality,,riding experience is atmost i have driven 15+kms in juzt 2 months pune to tirupati balaji and kolhapur telangana mumbai and many more locatins bit bat patches can say off-road too and highway driving was lesiure driving with cruze control its more fun to ride build quality performance everything is atmost just love the car.
,,build quality,,"performance is very well highly trustable in terms of engine and build quality  price is quite high as compared to other cars in this segment. 
"
,,build quality,,the build quality is nice.
,,build quality,,the build quality is nice.
,,build quality,,"i love thedesign and features provided in hyundai creta.you will get a great average,strong build quality, and great safety features."
,,build quality,,"best ever suv in this price the looks, the features, the build quality is awesome"
,,build quality,,"one of the best car ever seen .....this can lead to cool life.nice mileage, engine power, andstrong build quality."
,,build quality,,"otherwise i'd pick the harrier over it for its build quality (yes - latest xuv is quite flimsy) and overall ambience and simple classy layout. 
"
,,build quality,,i think this is a practical car where it offers 7airbags for safety and great build quality as we know toyota engines are the best in class with great reliability and have good resale value but misses some features like sunroof auto park assist which its rivals like endeavor offer.
,,build quality,,"handling, build quality, comfort is great in tatas car, but they work hard on engines"
,,build quality,,"the tata harrier is definitely the package of features, equipment, new-age design, best build quality, performance & the great road presence, but however is worth a wait for those looking to purchase a diesel automatic transmission sourced from hyundai and enthusiasts looking for a more punchy 170bhp for power."
,,build quality,,"both have superior build quality.

"
,,build quality,,"excellent build quality which offers better protection to occupants.
"
,,build quality,,"in recent years tata motors has drastically increased in its car build quality, design, quality material to stand in competition with other major brand like hyundai, ford, wolkwogun etc."
,,build quality,,"although a few build quality and finesse niggles are something to be expected in a tata vehicle (even the newer ones), i'm disheartened to learn that the harrier has so many, and they are so obviously evident! and the poor steering calibration is just inexcusable, since tata has never goofed up so bad in this department, before."
,,build quality,,"i bought a car last month xt variant over all tata is really doing a great job under budget, good build quality.i am here to say that i have taken and paid for the accessories like bumper chrome protector, boot chrome finish etc etc but when gthey handover the car to me the trunk mat was missing, they said they will get it in a week or so"
,,build quality,,"main reasona are 
- pathetic build quality
- below average service experience
- poor brand image
- long term reliability"
,,build quality,,"very good experience and tata has improved very much in terms of build quality, space and comfort, features and etc."
,,build quality,,"the following pros and cons of tata harrier as follows:

pros:
1. solid build quality and excellent sound quality with jbl speakers. 
"
,,build quality,,"the most striking part of the car is that it uses a land rover platform that leads it to an aggressive styling, good build quality."

,,build quality,,tata harrier is a super suv car because of its solid build quality.
,,build quality,,best build quality... awesome sound ... giant size ... best ever car by tata ...
,,build quality,,"amazing build quality and features, mydream car pickup and acceleration on the highway,"
,,build quality,,build quality is good.
,,build quality,,is the build quality of tata you can trust blindly on the car.maintenance of tata cars are also low and harrier gives a low cost maintenance service too.so kudos to tata motors for making a brilliant car like harrier !??
,,build quality,,"the build quality is  also so hard.......
by passing out of time,tata has made a lot of progress on it's service to make it more comfortable for customers.....
tata has put a lots of efforts to make this car and to make its service better than other car brands in india.........."
,,build quality,,"also, very powerful and strong build quality getting in this car."
,,build quality,,build quality of tata harrier is the best in the segment.
,,build quality,,great build quality.
,,build quality,,tataharrier is the safest car and price worth build quality is very good and the luxury class's an suv.
,,build quality,,"best suv for a person budgeting under 20 lakhs, amazing look and structure, great build quality, marvellous features ."
,,build quality,,"this segment is great and its build quality, luxurious, and the driving experience was awsome, i have claimed 19 kmpl from harrier because of its 3 driving modes eco, city and sport, the terrain response system is also wonderful i really love this vehicle."
,,build quality,,"the linear acceleration in also nice.theinterior is up to the mark in this segment and build quality is also good.overall,i am very happy with this car."

,,build quality,,"tata harrier has very good build quality and worth for money, interior is superior and also fun to drive, especially in the sport model."
,,build quality,,"the tata harrier is definitely the package of features, equipment, new-age design, best build quality, performance & the great road presence, but however is worth a wait for those looking to purchase a diesel automatictransmission sourced from hyundai and enthusiasts looking for a more punchy 170bhp for power."
,,build quality,,the build quality was appalling when i sat in the international model(which was btw in mint condition supposedly)
,,build quality,,bro how is build quality and crash test? and how much is weight of car?
,,build quality,,i think this suv will have strong build quality like volkswagen or tata.
,,build quality,,"compass's build quality, driving dynamics, safety, stability etc are far more superior than hector and harrier...along with it you get a tag  jeep...which completely justify it's price..."
,,build quality,,"mg hector is the best car in his segment and its reviews are awesome it has excellent features and it has a cruise control, it is all the system which has been come in this price range and first of all it has 360 camera build quality of good build quality good seats and the most awesome thing"
,,build quality,,"my experience isamazing with mg hector.the car is very spacious from inside, the cabin and the build quality is also strong."
,,build quality,,hector has awesome build quality.
,,build quality,,this car is first10.4 inch (0.26 m)touchscreen car mast build quality is best andsafetyfeatures are also best to like6airbags.
,,build quality,,"what a car, audi and benz looks overpriced in front of hector, super build quality n best safety features."
,,build quality,,build quality is very high.
,,build quality,,".. it comes with plenty of feature.. rich in space and comfort and the skoda build quality adds up to the value..

"
,,build quality,,poor build quality.
,,build quality,,poor build quality.
,,build quality,,"build quality and interior is quite good, the ride is also quite good."
,,build quality,,"the build quality seemed okay,better than a maruti but slightly inferior to my previous gen jazz and not comparable to fiat/vw/skoda cars. 
"
,,build quality,,"it has solid build quality with tight and uniform shutlines/panelgaps. 
"
,,build quality,,"better build quality 
much better engines 
proven the test of time"
,,build quality,,"build quality, interior part quality, feature list and space is good. 
"
,,build quality,,"as i suspected, absolutely nothing wrong with build quality externally."
,,build quality,,"no, but such build quality will disappear soon as the focus is on weight-savings, and frankly i find that hyundai/kia have the best balance of weight-saving & tactility over any brand today."
,,build quality,,"build quality may not be elantra/tucson level, but perfectly matches with its current price."
,,build quality,,"comparing jeep compass sports plus model with the top end diesel seltos, for 1 l extra, we will get a bigger, better capable, more fun to drive car with bigger engine, better build quality and multi link rear suspension."
,,build quality,,"more space, excellent ride and build quality, and"
,,build quality,,"after seeing  so many posts about the build quality had to write some points from my judgment of the seltos’s built during my showroom visit and td. 
"
,,build quality,,no test drive average build quality unresponsive dealers confused variant list (can never have a perfect model)
,,build quality,,"frankly, i didn't really find any substantial difference in build quality.    "
,,build quality,,"not sure how to look at this should one be happy that performance will be better than the other 2 or worried about build quality.
"
,,build quality,,"inferior build quality compared to hector (if this is similar to hyundai then metallic color will scratch easily) 
i had booked both seltos and hector."
,,build quality,,"hyundai is very close to the benchmark of build quality for me, and it's based purely on the 3 cars of theirs that i've owned - the santro xing was far above its competition during its day, then i owned the getz and to be honest the polo didn't seem in any way superior to it, quite the opposite as i've experienced cars like the indica and civic bang into it from behind and their bumpers were misaligned (the civic's bumper fell down) and nary a scratch on the getz."
,,build quality,,"though build quality isn't in any way related to safety, i like a good solid car as it improves noise isolation, helps in maintenance of body and the overall haptics would be that of a luxury car."
,,build quality,,on the other hand - i'd say hyundai isn't the benchmark of build quality either.
,,build quality,,"i'll take all the opinions here with a pinch of salt until i can personally check out the vehicle, but if all the opinions here on build quality, i.e door shut, haptics, panel rigidity etc are true, and even compared with the weakest link of them all - the maruti then i'm shocked beyond belief since globally, kia is seen as even better than hyundai in terms of build and interiors. 
"
,,build quality,,"i expected a better build quality, not saying it is not safe but after checking out a few well built cars this looks ordinary."
,,build quality,,"he read the thread carefully over a few days and seeing adverse comments made about build quality, lack of equipment etc, he conveyed that he will test drive, wait for the price release and maybe quietly go and book the creta since it is tried, tested and has a track record in our climate and environment. 
"
,,build quality,,1. build quality definitely not better than creta.
,,build quality,,we currently drive the fortuner (10 year old)/polo gt tsi (2 year old)/jazz (9 year old) and the seltos was a replacement planned for the jazz but looking at the light build quality both of us were thoroughly disappointed.
,,build quality,,"all this observation about light build quality is really a big negative, considering how much the invited media had to praise about the car being european in quality and drive experience.  
"
,,build quality,,"no way 1.5l diesel can give such excellent acceleration numbers with ""european build quality""."
,,build quality,,i see a few let downs on the forum with regards to the build quality and performance.
,,build quality,,"i am willing to bet that the existing creta will have better build quality and engine performance than the seltos at the expense of a sunroof, tablet etc.  
"
,,build quality,,"however, there's enough clearance.  
unless the build quality is a one-off case in this particular car, i really have my reservations."
,,build quality,,"the build quality, as pointed out by many, doesn't feel at par with the likes of the germans or the americans."
,,build quality,,"the first thing that hit me, is the build quality, the doors just don't have any heft, forget european, even the ford ecosport is miles ahead in terms of solid feeling, even the creta feels marginally better built."
,,build quality,,don't expect this to be any better than a hyundai or a honda when it comes to build quality and dynamics.
,,build quality,,": i've pre-booked the seltos gtx dct (gtx+ wasn't available when i booked) and honestly with my td of the htx manual diesel at bhavna kia, panvel, i felt the build quality to be more maruti-like, may be slightly better."
,,build quality,,"my feelings: 
- build quality seemed ok - nothing to write home about."
,,build quality,,"lets put it this way, the build quality difference is what one has experienced with the city vs vento (interior & exterior wise)"
,,build quality,,"interior:
the materials used are premium, atleast in most spaces: 
build quality- quite good, will wait for the crash test rating to comment further. 
"
,,build quality,,"i have both tiago and verna fluidic and hence first hand experience in difference in build quality.
"
,,build quality,,"i have both tiago and verna fluidic and hence first hand experience in difference in build quality.
"
,,build quality,,but that's an over simplistic way of measuring build quality.

,,build quality,,"build quality, seating, boot space, cabin space, engine, everything wise a full comparision would be much appreciated."
,,build quality,,also the overall build quality is pretty average compared to the toyota interiors.
,,build quality,,"no point in arguing since its only a matter of perception of individuals, however hyundai is only known for decently reliable, they have not engineered anything exceptional at all when compared to something like cruze.  
also, ofcourse awaiting further reviews from more reliable sources like t-bhp, however again personally to me hector's build quality and showroom quality oozed of premiumness, whereas seltos seems to be run of the mill average car to me."
,,build quality,,but i am a bit worried the build quality and safety may not be great.

,,safety features,,"and it has sport, eco and city modeit has automatic claimate control ac. and rear blower with heater seafty feature included areabs, ebd, traction control system, esp, hill hold control, hill decent control."
,,safety features,,"but i have to say that comfort and riding quality of this car is fantabulous and it stands out from its rivals also in these terms.the engine is upto 1956 cc and the car also offers many driving modes.the sound quality is really amazing because of the 9 jbl speakers and an amplifier.the tata harrier offers a 425 liters of boot it can be expanded upto 800 liters also.the back seat is also very spacious with a good headroom and legroom the rear ac vents are placed on the side that gives more space in the back.overall tata harrier is actually a strong package it gives an option of manual gearbox and diesel engine option for now only but there are some small features that tata motors should offer like the panaromic sunroof and some more updates in the infotainment screen it will add more sense and give the practical feel to this car.in terms of safety the car gives passenger and driver side airbags apart from it there are many other safety features also like hill hold assist,abs,ebd,traction control etc.i like the harrier so much, as a student i can't buy this car right now ??"
,,safety features,,"apart from these, the advanced esp also features electronic traction control and hydraulic brake assist."

,,safety features,,"-100 takes around 11 second.. 
safety features are very good in hector.. from base model itself.. they give (abs, ebd, esp, traction control, hill hold, dual airbags)"
,,safety features,,"if i was to compare it with the hector, i'd say that mg has done a better job in offering a safer product with the base variant getting 2 airbags and the ones above getting 4 and 6 airbags respectively with the hill assist, traction control , rear disc brakes etc coming as standard across all variants."
,,safety features,,"such as additional safety, hill hold, traction control, better alloys, powerful engine etc.

,,safety features,,"quote:    and like the other two automatic variants, the diesel at gets three driving modes (normal, eco, and sport) along with three traction control settings, including mud, wet, and sand."
,,safety features,,i also wanted to add that the currently displayed htx+ diesel is also missing the traction control (esp) as the button to switch it off besides was also missing just like its neighbouring missing hud button.
,,safety features,,"so the top end diesel variant (htx+ at) will come with only 2 airbags, no rear disc breaks, no traction control, no drive and terrain modes?"
,,safety features,,we really need those drive modes and traction control for the 1.4 turbo petrol gtx+ 6 spd manual... its only available in the dct model...
,,safety features,,"the infotainment system is great as itsupportsmost regional language.regardingsafety best in thesuvsegment as it loaded with6airbags, esp, traction control,ebd,"
